<p style="text-align: center"><img class='img-responsive' alt="GovEx" src="/images/govexlogo-large.png"></p>

Johns Hopkins University’s new Center for Government Excellence helps governments build capacity for decision making that is rooted in evidence, transparent accountability, and citizen engagement. The interdisciplinary center is part of the university’s 21st Century Cities Initiative, a cross-disciplinary research effort for urban study and change.

The new center educates governments about best practices for the collection, measurement, and analysis of data, helping them to better assess job functions, improve service delivery, decrease waste, and engender public trust.
